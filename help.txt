Built on Python 2.7 with Kivy, Fluidsynth, Mingus

List of Questionable Crap I Did To Make This Work

1. Download Mingus, install as module then copy folders to this for standalone
2. Add pyfluidsynth.py etc.. to Mingus folder
3. Change pyfluidsynth to look for fluidsynth.dll in program directory
4. GET THE STINKIN' RIGHT VERSION OF FLUIDSYNTH.DLL. FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.
5. Neglect the Kivy Language (.kv), which is probably a horrible idea.
7. Waste a bunch of time fiddling with the layout
8. Waste time fiddling with my program
6. Attempt to do something legit based on my cursory Carnatic knowledge

Thanks to Mingus and pyFluidSynth. Both amazing modules, really.
Oh, and *Kivy* of course.
