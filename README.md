Mediocre Music Synthesis Using Kivy

- Written in Python 2.7.
- Uses Kivy, Mingus, and FluidSynth modules.

### Source Notes

- Look at help.txt for usage notes and future plans.
- Download Kivy from kivy.org to run this.

### Requirements

- A mediocre SoundFont has been included in this repo.
- Simply replace fluid.sf2 if you wish to change it.
- I recommend the Fluid R3 SoundFont, designed for FluidSynth.

### Demo

- You can download an executable version of this.
- Check my website, and I'll probably have it there.
- That version includes the Fluid R3 SoundFont.
