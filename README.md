DJ Slate
=============
Mediocre Music Synthesis Using Kivy.

- Written in Python 2.7.
- Uses Kivy, Mingus, and FluidSynth modules.

### Source Notes

- Look at help.txt for usage notes and future plans.
- Download Kivy from kivy.org to run this.

### Requirements

- You must download a SoundFont to use DJ Slate.
- It must exist in the same directory, and be named fluid.sf2.
- I recommend the Fluid R3 SoundFont, designed for FluidSynth.

### Demo

- You can download an executable version of this.
- Check my website, and I'll probably have it there.
- This version includes the Fluid R3 SoundFont.
